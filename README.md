# ðŸŒŸ **Powerful API Design** ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

This project is an example of my skills in web development using TypeScript, JavaScript, Prisma, Express, and PostgreSQL.
It's a RESTful API that implements various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Enhances code robustness with static typing.
  
- **JavaScript**: Adds dynamic functionalities, ensuring seamless web integration.
  
- **Prisma**: Modern toolkit for efficient and type-safe database interactions in TypeScript and Node.js.
  
- **Express**: Minimalistic Node.js framework for building RESTful APIs.
  
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for scalability and reliability in the open-source relational database system.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Complete implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data effectively.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript is employed for enhanced code quality, reducing potential runtime errors.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless interaction with PostgreSQL using Prisma for efficient and secure data storage.
- **Express Routing**: Well-organized API routes with Express for clear and structured endpoint management.

## Getting Started
